# Jellyvision Engineer Audition

Hi there! This audition is meant as an opportunity to show us your technical skills. Review the README and/or INSTRUCTIONS document in the pbj directory, then work your way through the audition. When you're done, zip up the folder and send it back to your Jellyvision contact.

We thank you for putting up with our exhaustive interview process. We know it can be grueling, but we want to make sure that you're right for this role and that this role is right for you. You'll hear from us in a few days about what the next steps will be.

## What resources can I use?
Use any resource you can find, as long as it's not another live person. That means Google and Stack Overflow are totally inbounds, but Slack, IRC, and your programmer friend are not.

Of course, you're taking this audition remotely, so we have no way of knowing if you're cheating ... but you wouldn't do that, right?

## Can I use any libraries or frameworks?
Unless specifically indicated, you shouldn't add any libraries or frameworks to use in the functions you write. However, feel free to add or use libraries when writing your tests.

## Hey, is this audition supposed to be in a git repository?
Good eye! We want to get a sense of *how you work* along with *what you write*, so you should make commits as you normally would while working on the audition. When we review your audition, we'll be looking at the repository history along with the actual code you wrote. Please include it when you zip it up and send it over.

**It is very important that you do not alter anything in the `.git` folder.** It masks your identity so that we can review your audition without knowing who submitted it. This helps to reduce bias in our reviews.

## What if I don't finish in time?
That's okay! Do the best you can. We'd rather see less really good code than more kinda okay code.

## Anything else I should do?
You know, the usual: comment your code, write good tests, all that stuff. This is your chance to show us your technical chops, so represent yourself well! Oh, and *don't* use your name anywhere in your audition; we identity-redact our auditions so they can be judged blindly.
